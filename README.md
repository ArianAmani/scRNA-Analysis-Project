## Final project preparation for the graduate course "ML for Bioinformatics" at Sharif University of Technology | Spring 2023
In the Fall of 2022, I had the opportunity to be a part of the wonderful Teaching Team of the course `Introduction to Machine Learning`, offered by the Computer Engineering Department at Sharif University of Technology where we recorded and constructed a completely free, open-source, and thorough course targeting B.Sc. students interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

All the material from that course is available from this repository: [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/asharifiz/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning)

---
As an extension of that course, in the next semester (Spring 2023), I got the chance to again, serve as a Teaching Assistant in the course `ML for Bioinformatics`, offered for Masters students of the Engineering Department at Sharif University of Technology.

As for phase 1 of the course's final project, I have designed a walkthrough notebook with questions on `Single-Cell RNAseq Analysis` which is available in this repository.

For the second phase of the final project, each student will propose their own topic (on scRNA) and will present their project and results, at the end of the semester.
